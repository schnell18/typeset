  // Readiness allows a plugin to report its initialization status back
  // to the CO. Initialization for some plugins MAY be time consuming
  // and it is important for a CO to distinguish between the following
  // cases:
  //
  // 1) The plugin is in an unhealthy state and MAY need restarting. In
  //    this case a gRPC error code SHALL be returned.
  // 2) The plugin is still initializing, but is otherwise perfectly
  //    healthy. In this case a successful response SHALL be returned
  //    with a readiness value of `false`. Calls to the plugin's
  //    Controller and/or Node services MAY fail due to an incomplete
  //    initialization state.
  // 3) The plugin has finished initializing and is ready to service
  //    calls to its Controller and/or Node services. A successful
  //    response is returned with a readiness value of `true`.
  //
  // This field is OPTIONAL. If not present, the caller SHALL assume
  // that the plugin is in a ready state and is accepting calls to its
  // Controller and/or Node services (according to the plugin's reported
  // capabilities).
